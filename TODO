We could potentially integrate better with Flask modules if we'd allow
referencing static files from bundles the way you can reference templates:
"module/file" would select "module/static/file".
Some work is required in webassets to enable this. Possibly the right
thing would be to implement general support for custom filesystems (like
S3), and build this upon it.

Maybe add support for automatic bundle-loading from assets.py files,
Django-like. However, since we have no single, global environment, we'd
prefer to collect all "Bundle" instances from a module, rather than
attempting something like g.assets_env.register().

Using loaders is currently somewhat verbose, it'd be more micro-framework-like
if we  could say "assets_env.load('yaml', ...)".
